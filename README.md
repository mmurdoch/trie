# trie
A trie. Used for retrieving words matching a prefix. Useful, for example,
in predictive typing applications.

# Building
Run `./build` to compile, run tests and the example application.

**Note:** The example application (in `trie-example.c`) expects to find a dictionary in `/usr/share/dict/words`.
